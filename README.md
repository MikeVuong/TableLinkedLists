# TableLinkedLists
Linked list/Table assignment that required the developer to make a modular linked list that was able to adjust it's size based on the amount of the values that were given

Tasks that were given by the professor that had to be implemented: 
1. The values can be added from either the head and tail ends of the table
2. The values can be removed from either the head or tail ends of the table
3. The values can be searched based on user input 
4. The values can be sorted iteratively from start to finish
5. The values can be quick sorted based on a developer created quick sort algorithm
